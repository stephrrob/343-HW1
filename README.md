## Git Commands

Git provides numerous commands for managing version control. Here are some of the most commonly used Git commands:

### Basic Commands

1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

2. `git add <file>`: Stages a specific file for commit.

3. `git add .`: Stages all modified and new files in the current directory.

4. `git commit -m "Commit message"`: Creates a new commit with the staged changes and adds a commit message.

5. `git status`: Shows the current state of the repository, including tracked and untracked files.

### Branching and Merging

6. `git branch`: Lists all local branches.

7. `git checkout <branch-name>`: Switches to a specific branch.

8. `git merge <branch>`: Merges changes from a specified branch into the current branch.

9. `git log`: Displays the commit history of the current branch.

### Remote Operations

10. `git push <remote> <branch>`: Pushes local commits to a specified remote branch.

11. `git pull`: Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

12. `git fetch`: Retrieves changes from a remote repository without merging.

### Inspection and Comparison

13. `git diff`: Shows changes between the working directory and the staging area.

14. `git log --follow <file>`: Displays the commit history of a file, including its renames.

15. `git show <commit>`: Shows the details of a specific commit, including its changes.

These commands cover many essential Git operations, from basic version control to branching, merging, and remote repository management. Understanding these commands will help me effectively manage my Git repositories.
